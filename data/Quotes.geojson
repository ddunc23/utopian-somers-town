The book purports to be an \u2018archaeology\u2019 of the Kesh, a people who live in an unspecified point in the far future in what is currently Northern California. Rather than presenting a conventional narrative, the novel is an assemblage of stories and anthropological observations made by \u2018Pandora\u2019, a visitor to this society, a stand-in for the author.

After digging in several wrong places for over a year and persisting in several blockheaded opinions--that it must be walled, with one gate, for instance--I was studying yet once more the contours of my map of the region, when it dawned as slowly and as certainly as the sun itself upon me that the town was there, between the creeks, under my feet the whole time. And there was never a wall; what on earth did they need a wall for? What I had taken for the gate was the bridge across the meeting of the creeks. And the sacred buildings and the dancing place not in the center of town, for the center is the Hinge, but over in their own arm of the double spiral, the right arm, of course--there in the pasture below the barn. And so it is, and so it is.</p>\n\n<p>[...]</p>\n\n<p>But I can't go digging there and hope to find the curved fragment of a roof tile, the iridescent foot of a wine goblet, the ceramic cap of a solar battery, or a little coin of the gold of California [...] I can walk in the wild oats and the thistles, between the houses of the little town I was looking for, Sinshan.</p>\n\n<p>[...] </p>\n\n<p>If I listen, can I hear voices with the inner ear?

The most notable resident of the street was the Irish poet and mystic W. B. Yeats, who lived here between 1895-1919. During this period Yeats was a member of an occult society, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (also headquartered in Bloomsbury), whose membership included Moina Mathers, sister of Henri Bergson; the children\u2019s author Edith Nesbit; and the \u2018wickedest man in the world\u2019, the occultist Aleister Crowley. Arthur Machen, a prolific writer of supernatural and horror fiction, was also a member. His collection of interlinked short stories, The Three Imposters, details a series of grisly crimes, all of which concern an enigmatic \u2018young man in spectacles\u2019 who bears a more than passing resemblance to Yeats. The following extract describes the moment in which Dyson, one of the protagonists of the stories, finally encounters the young man in a pub.<p>\n    \n<blockquote>\"Mr. Davies! For God's sake, have pity on me, Mr. Davies. On my oath, I say---\" and his voice sank to silence as he heard the message, and strove in vain to bite his lip; and summon up to his aid some tinge of manhood. He stood there a moment, wavering as the leaves of an aspen, and then he was gone out into the street, as Dyson thought silently, with his doom upon his head. He had not been gone a minute when it suddenly flashed into Dyson's mind that he knew the man; it was undoubtedly the young man with spectacles for whom so many ingenious persons were searching; the spectacles indeed were missing, but the pale face, the dark whiskers, and the timid glances were enough to identify him. Dyson saw at once that by a succession of hazards he had unawares hit upon the scent of some desperate conspiracy, wavering as the track of a loathsome snake in and out of the highways and byways of the London cosmos; the truth was instantly pictured before him, and he divined that all unconscious and unheeding he had been privileged to see the shadows of hidden forms, chasing and hurrying, and grasping and vanishing across the bright curtain of common life, soundless and silent, or only babbling fables and pretences.</blockquote>"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.131351, 51.530969]}, "properties": {"title": "The Polygon", "body": "<h3>From <em>The Last Man</em> by Mary Shelley (1826)</h3>\n\n<p>Mary Shelley was the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft, author of \u2018A Vindication of the Rights of Women\u2019, and the anarchist philosopher William Godwin. She was born in a house on this site in 1797; 10 days after, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia following an infection she developed in childbirth. Shelley is now best known for her novel Frankenstein; however, her novel The Last Man, though overlooked (if not rejected) at the time of its publication, has striking contemporary resonances. The novel is a dystopian fiction set in late-21st century Britain, in which a plague has killed off most of the world\u2019s population. It is presented, not as fiction, but as assembled from prophecies that Shelley claims to have found in the cave of the Cumaean Sybil; the ancient Greek prophetess whose temple was in Cumae, near Naples.<p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We had now to descend a steep and rugged path, which led us to the mouth of a cavern. The entrance was small, and we were obliged to crawl on our hands and knees for some distance. The air was damp and cold; but we were soon in a large chamber, where the light of day was admitted through a narrow aperture, which was overgrown with brambles. The walls were covered with moss, and the floor was strewed with leaves. We had not been long in this place before we heard a noise like the rustling of wings, and I felt a cold breath pass over my face. I turned to my companion, who was standing at the entrance, and saw that he was pale and trembling. He said that he had seen something move in the darkness, but I could see nothing. We sat down on the ground, and I took out my notebook to write down what I had seen.</p>\n<p> a succession of these [passages], which our resolution alone permitted us to surmount, we arrived at a wide cavern with an arched dome-like roof. An aperture in the midst let in the light of heaven; but this was overgrown with brambles and underwood, which acted as a veil, obscuring the day, and giving a solemn religious hue to the apartment. It was spacious, and nearly circular, with a raised seat of stone, about the size of a Grecian couch, at one end. The only sign that life had been here, was the perfect snow-white skeleton of a goat, which had probably not perceived the opening as it grazed on the hill above, and had fallen headlong. Ages perhaps had elapsed since this catastrophe; and the ruin it had made above, had been repaired by the growth of vegetation during many hundred summers. </p>\n<p>At length my friend, who had taken up some of the leaves strewed about, exclaimed, \"This is the Sibyl's cave; these are Sibylline leaves.\" On examination, we found that all the leaves, bark, and other substances were traced with written characters. What appeared to use more astonishing, was that these writing were expressed in various languages: some unknown to my companion, ancient Chaldee, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, as old as the Pyramids. Stranger still, some were in modern dialects, English and Italian. We could make out little by the dim light, but they seemed to contain prophecies, detailed relations of events but lately passed; names, now well known, but of modern date; and often exclamations of exultation or woe, of victory or defeat, were traced on their thin scant pages.</p>\n\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n\n<p>I present the public with my latest discoveries in the slight Sibylline pages. Scattered and unconnected as they are, I have been obliged to add links, and model the work into a consistent form. But the main substance rests on the truths contained in these poetic rhapsodies, and the divine intuitions which the Cumaean damsel obtained from heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>"}}, {"type": "Feature", "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.130984, 51.535267]}, "properties": {"title": "St Pancras Old Church", "body": "<h3>From <em>Vale Royal</em> by Aidan Dun (1995)</h3>\n\n<p>St Pancras Old Church is supposedly one of the oldest sites of Christian worship in Britain, though the building now here was constructed in the 19th Century.

This is one of two Portland stone lodges, built in a monumental neoclassical style, designed by the engineer J. B. Stansby in 1870. They are now Grade-II listed and are the only buildings to survive the controversial demolition of old Euston Station in the 1960s. The Glass Bar\u2019s tenure in the West Lodge made it both \u2018the most architecturally recognized queer venue in London and one of the most discrete, hidden in plain sight within the urban fabric\u2019. McKenzie had found London\u2019s queer venues to be dominated by white lesbian and gay people, and as a result - in her words - \u2018cold and cliquey\u2019; she\u2019s recounted that as \u2018a black gay person you had parties in odd places\u2019. She wanted to provide a welcoming space for all women. Reflecting the West Lodge\u2019s proximity to the universities of Bloomsbury, McKenzie\u2019s 1995 planning application to Camden Council proposed a change of use from an office \u2018to a meeting place and networking venue\u2019 for \u2018academic and professional women\u2019. The membership model and \u00a31 joining fee enabled McKenzie to prioritise women\u2019s access. Her policy was, she says, \u2018if you identified as a woman, that\u2019s it you could come [\u2026] so we had cis and trans women in\u2019. Despite striving to uphold an inclusive atmosphere, McKenzie herself experienced racist behaviour, such as being challenged about how she funded the bar, or being talked over, when white customers chose to address her white staff members. The Glass Bar was Tardis-like, bigger than it appeared from the outside, with an upstairs room and ground floor bar, linked by a spiral staircase. The bar offered a meeting place for women\u2019s social networks, including \u2018Kiss\u2019, a group for queer Asian women.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n    <p>Queerness is not yet here. Queerness is an ideality. Put another way, we are not yet queer, but we can feel it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality. We have never been queer, yet queerness exists for us as an ideality that can be distilled from the past and used to imagine a future. The future is queerness's domain.\n\n    <p>[...]</p>\n\n    <p>The here and now is a prison house. We must strive, in the face of the here and now\u2019s totalising rendering of reality, to think and feel a then and there. Some will say that all we have are the pleasures of this moment, but we must never settle for that minimal transport; we must dream and enact new and better pleasures, other ways of being in the world, and ultimately new worlds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n"}}]}
